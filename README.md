# ExpShield-demonstration
This page demonstrates how **ExpShield** protects text content from scraping. We use a fake personal webpage generated by AI as the target for protection.

## Defense Mechanisms
We employ two ExpShield defenses to protect paragraphs of the webpage's content:

### 1. Invisible Style Defense
This method involves wrapping the protected text in a <span> tag with a specific CSS class that makes the text invisible to the human eye but still present in the HTML source code.

We insert  ``<span class='invisible-text'>ExpShield</span>`` into each word. The corresponding CSS is:
```css title="css"
/* CSS */
.invisible-text {
    font-size: 0;
    line-height: 0;
}
```

### 2. Invisible Character Defense

Insert invisible characters directly into words, e.g., ``Today â†’ Tod&ZeroWidthSpace;ay``
(Here an invisible character is inserted between d and a.)

------------

### Browser Render Result

The protected webpage renders identically to the original. See the figure below.
